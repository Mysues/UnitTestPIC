CeedlingExample_Microchip
=========================

An example project demonstrating how to configure Ceedling for use with Microchip's compiler and simulator.

See http://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/10/22/getting-started-with-tdd-for-microchips-pics/ for a walkthough/tutorial that goes along with this project.

=========================

This project requires that the following is installed on your computer
* Ruby (http://rubyinstaller.org/)
* Ceedling gem (gem install ceedling)
* Microchip XC16 compiler - Cross-platform C compiler for 16 bit PICs (http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en_us/promo/mplabxc/)

=========================

Edit: 11/01/2021

* You only need to change XC16 compiler path (line 34) inside "project.yml" file to yours.
